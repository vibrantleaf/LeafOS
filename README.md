Just my personal fork of [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/).

Built using [Blue Build](https://blue-build.org/) and [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/).

I'm aiming for sharkfin to be a sort of half way point bettween being a nice workstation system like Bluefin while still having the ablitey to run games as well as Bazzite, with some of my own custom modifications.

Sharkfin is currently only intended for usage on Desktop & Laptop systems not a Handheld, Tablet or aLiving Room environment.

Please read the [sharkfin wiki](https://github.com/vibrantleaf/sharkfin/wiki) Before use.
